# Example Wizard Style Web Application using Lit-Html

This repository contains a simple wizard modelling a donation form over multiple steps. It was initialized using the Vue CLI but uses [Lit-Html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/) as a view rendering module instead in order to show that carefully composed vanilla JS classes can be more descriptive and succinct than using a third-party framework.

## Project setup

yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

yarn analyze
```
